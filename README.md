# Approximate-Bayesian-Computation <br> 
Hello every one
In this set of codes, I have used importance sampling and rejection sampling methods for estimating the parameters of a mathematical model. The model is a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model for simulation of photosynthesis. This model is implemented within the BioCro package in R by Dr.Fernando Miguez (http://miguezlab.agron.iastate.edu).
